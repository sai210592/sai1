 Fix workding for :ref|term: subsitution

 now matches 'seealso' and makes more sense:

  ```
  delay:
  applies_to:
  - Task
  description: Number of seconds to delay between retries. This setting is only used
    in combination with `until`.
  ```
 vs
  ```
  delay:
  applies_to:
  - Task
  description: Number of seconds to delay between retries. This setting is only used
    in combination with website for `until`.
  ```

* updated unit tests

* match see also

* more sanity:

i am updating this file again to test on the commit.
